# Design_Computational_Aesthetics
## Research notes about machine learning and design research

- Goal: To create a prototype to demonstrate the possible design research idea/theory
- Method/Tools: Tensorflow/Python
- Theoretical framework: computational aeshtetics, noticing, anthroposcene
- Timeline: setup(~june), expore(july+aug), refine(sept+oct), writeup/polish(nov)
- outcome: writing and (interactive) prototype/visualizataion
